Works for links that youtube-dl can open.

 - xdg-utils _(linux only)_

## Acknowledgements
This project was inspired by akiirui's
[userscript](https://github.com/akiirui/userscript/tree/play-with-mpv-handler) and
[mpv-handler](https://github.com/akiirui/mpv-handler/), with the latter's ideas being
heavily borrowed from in my implementation.
