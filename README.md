# Chrome extension to open video links with mpv
Adds a context menu option so that youtube can be browsed normally as well.
It might not work for most sites, but it works for youtube.

## Dependencies
 - [mpv](https://mpv.io)
 - [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl)

## Acknowledgements
This project was inspired by akiirui's
[userscript](https://github.com/akiirui/userscript/tree/play-with-mpv-handler) and
[mpv-handler](https://github.com/akiirui/mpv-handler/), with the latter's ideas being
heavily borrowed from in my implementation.
